The purpose of this repository is to post my solutions to Project Euler questions. I will also be updating/uploading a library that connects this process with the module-building progression from O'Reilly's Intermediate Perl book. I also plan to come back to some of these to do a bit more opimization. 

Update: 8/31/2014
I'm going through and optimizing some of my first few solutions so there's a bit of a gap.
